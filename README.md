# Create A Code Demo Repo

This is a convenience shell script for creating a simple
project directory for code demo purposes.

I simply pasted it in my ~/.zshrc file.

In the future, I'd like to add a bit of scaffolding logic to it, e.g. "configure Webpack and Babel for a React demo" or "install Sequelize and Express for a simple backend"
